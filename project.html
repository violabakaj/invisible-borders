    <h2>Project & Methodology</h2>

<h3>Project Design and Structure</h3>

<p>
“Invisible Borders” is structured as an interdisciplinary environmental research project that examines pollution as a transport-driven system. The project is built on the premise that environmental risk is not determined solely by the chemical identity of pollutants, but largely by the physical mechanisms that govern how those pollutants move through air and water pathways.
</p>

<p>
The overall design follows a systems-based logic:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identification of dominant transport pathways in industrial environments (air and water)</li>
  <li>Analysis of the physical laws governing pollutant dispersion and migration</li>
  <li>Conceptual development of preventive interception and control strategies</li>
  <li>Translation of scientific principles into structured visual and educational formats</li>
</ul>

<p>
The project connects scientific theory with clear communication, ensuring both analytical rigor and accessibility.
</p>

<h3>Methodological Approach</h3>

<p>
The methodological framework of “Invisible Borders” is grounded in established scientific theory and integrates five complementary disciplines: physics, mathematics, chemistry, environmental biology, and informatics. The approach is analytical, preventive, and transport-centered.
</p>

<h4>1. Physics-Based Transport Modeling</h4>

<p>
Pollutant movement is interpreted through fundamental transport principles:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Advection (transport driven by wind or flowing water)</li>
  <li>Diffusion (dispersion caused by concentration gradients)</li>
  <li>Turbulence and airflow structure</li>
  <li>Flow through porous media</li>
</ul>

<p>
This framework allows environmental pollution to be analyzed as a dynamic system governed by velocity fields, residence time, permeability, and transport distance. Instead of focusing exclusively on emission quantities, the methodology emphasizes how environmental conditions influence dispersion patterns and exposure risk.
</p>

<h4>2. Mathematical Analysis and Comparative Reasoning</h4>

<p>
Mathematics provides the structural backbone of the analytical framework. The project applies conceptual and comparative modeling to formalize cause–effect relationships between environmental variables.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conceptual application of advection–diffusion relationships</li>
  <li>Comparative baseline–mitigation analysis</li>
  <li>Logical scaling relationships (e.g., increased residence time → increased interception potential)</li>
  <li>Structured evaluation of transport distance and mobility under different conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>
Rather than relying on complex numerical simulations, the methodology emphasizes analytical clarity and logical consistency.
</p>

<h4>3. Chemical Behavior and Interaction Mechanisms</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Volatility of fuel-related compounds such as VOCs and BTEX</li>
  <li>Air–water partitioning behavior</li>
  <li>Sorption and adsorption potential on porous materials</li>
  <li>Persistence of hydrophobic pollutants such as PAHs</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Environmental and Biological Relevance</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Inhalation exposure through atmospheric transport</li>
  <li>Indirect exposure through water and soil migration</li>
  <li>Environmental persistence and accumulation potential</li>
  <li>Long-term attenuation processes</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Digital Documentation and Knowledge Translation</h4>

<p>
A dedicated static website was developed and published via GitHub Pages to ensure transparency and structured documentation. The platform is organized into six sections: Home, Project / Methodology, Experiments, Gallery, “Are You Safe?” (Questionnaire), and Responses.
</p>

<p>
The 11-question survey titled “Are You Safe?” was created and distributed using Google Forms to assess environmental awareness, pollution perception, and responsibility attribution. The collected responses are presented in a structured visual format within the website.
</p>

<h3>Methodological Philosophy</h3>

<p>
The overarching philosophy of the project is preventive and systems-oriented. The methodology prioritizes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mechanism-based understanding over isolated measurements</li>
  <li>Logical and mathematical consistency over descriptive assumptions</li>
  <li>Interdisciplinary integration</li>
  <li>Prevention before remediation</li>
</ul>

<p>
By combining physical transport theory, mathematical reasoning, chemical interaction analysis, environmental relevance, and digital communication, “Invisible Borders” establishes a scientifically coherent and scalable framework for understanding and reducing pollution risk in industrial and peri-urban contexts.
