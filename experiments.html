    <h3>Physics-Based Demonstrations of Pollution Control</h3>

<p>
“Invisible Borders” includes two core demonstrative models that explain how environmental pollution spreads and how it can be reduced through physical pathway control. Each experiment focuses on one major transport route: air and water.
</p>

<h3>1. Air Pathway Demonstration</h3>
<h4>Vapor Capture & Multi-Stage Treatment Model</h4>

<h5>Objective</h5>
<p>
To demonstrate how polluted vapors from fuel-related activities can be intercepted at the source before spreading toward nearby residential areas.
</p>

<h5>The Problem</h5>
<p>
Airborne pollutants such as VOCs, BTEX compounds, and PAHs are transported by wind (advection) and turbulent mixing. Once released, these pollutants may travel significant distances depending on airflow conditions.
</p>

<h5>The Physical Principle</h5>
<p>Pollutant dispersion depends on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wind velocity</li>
  <li>Turbulence structure</li>
  <li>Distance from the source</li>
</ul>

<p>
If pollutants are captured before entering the surrounding airflow field, their downwind transport can be significantly reduced.
</p>

<h5>The Proposed Solution</h5>
<p>The model illustrates an at-source vapor capture system combined with a multi-stage treatment unit, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vapor capture hood (source interception)</li>
  <li>Prefilter stage</li>
  <li>Carbon/biochar adsorption layer</li>
  <li>Conceptual oxidation stage</li>
  <li>Monitoring and real-time alert representation</li>
</ul>

<h5>What the Model Demonstrates</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Reducing the mass of pollutants released reduces plume formation.</li>
  <li>Multi-stage systems improve removal reliability.</li>
  <li>Transport control is more efficient when applied near the emission source.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is a conceptual engineering model designed for scientific communication and education, not an industrial-scale prototype.
</p>

<h3>2. Water Pathway Demonstration</h3>
<h4>Multi-Layer Filtration Column System</h4>

<h5>Objective</h5>
<p>
To demonstrate how contaminated water can be clarified and pollutant mobility reduced using layered filtration principles.
</p>

<h5>The Problem</h5>
<p>
Pollutants deposited on surfaces may be mobilized by rainfall and transported through runoff into soil and aquatic systems.
</p>

<h5>The Physical Principle</h5>
<p>Transport in water is governed by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flow velocity</li>
  <li>Permeability of the medium</li>
  <li>Residence time</li>
  <li>Surface area for interaction</li>
</ul>

<p>
Slower flow and increased contact time improve pollutant retention.
</p>

<h5>System Structure</h5>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Baseline System:</strong> Physical filtration only</li>
  <li><strong>Physical + Chemical System:</strong> Addition of adsorption media (e.g., activated carbon/biochar)</li>
  <li><strong>Integrated System:</strong> Combined physical, chemical, and conceptual biological layer</li>
</ul>

<h5>What the Model Demonstrates</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Single-layer filtration provides limited control.</li>
  <li>Adding adsorption media reduces pollutant mobility.</li>
  <li>Layered systems improve retention by increasing contact time and surface interaction.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Integrated Insight</h3>

<p>
Together, the two experiments demonstrate a central scientific message:
</p>

<p><strong>
Environmental risk can be reduced by controlling transport pathways in air and water before pollutants spread widely.
