  <h2>Are You Safe?</h2>

<p>
“Ever wondered how things we cannot see move right through our backyard?
Dive into the Invisible Borders of Porto Romano to discover how pollution
travels and affects our environment.”
</p>

<p>
This structured 11-question survey was developed to evaluate environmental
awareness, perception of pollution transport, and responsibility attribution
within industrial and peri-urban contexts.
</p>

<h3>Survey Structure</h3>

<p>The questionnaire is organized into four thematic sections:</p>

<h4>1. Demographic Profile</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Age group</li>
  <li>School level / educational background</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Local Awareness</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Familiarity with the Porto Romano area</li>
  <li>Awareness of fuel storage facilities</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Perception of Environmental Risk</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Perceived harmfulness of fuel-related pollution</li>
  <li>Understanding of affected environmental compartments (air, water, ecosystems, health)</li>
  <li>Knowledge of pollution transport pathways (air, water, human activity)</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Environmental Responsibility and Engagement</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Concern about local environmental pollution</li>
  <li>Participation in environmental activities</li>
  <li>Responsibility attribution for pollution reduction</li>
</ul>

<p>
The survey uses structured multiple-choice questions to ensure clarity,
comparability of responses, and consistency in data interpretation.
</p>

<p><strong>
Participation is voluntary and responses are collected anonymously
for educational and analytical purposes.
