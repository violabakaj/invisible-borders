  <h2>Project Overview</h2>

  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    Industrial and fuel storage facilities located near residential areas represent a significant environmental and public health concern. In many industrial zones worldwide, including Porto Romano in Durrës, Albania, fuel handling and storage activities may release hazardous pollutants such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene), petroleum hydrocarbons, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
  </p>

  <p>
    These pollutants are not confined to the site of emission. Atmospheric airflow, turbulence, rainfall runoff, and soil transport processes allow contaminants to migrate beyond industrial boundaries and reach surrounding communities. This creates “invisible borders” of exposure that are not immediately detectable but may influence air quality, water systems, soil integrity, ecosystems, and human health over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    While environmental risk is often approached primarily as a chemical contamination issue, pollutant spread is fundamentally governed by physical transport mechanisms. Wind-driven advection, diffusion, turbulence, surface runoff, and subsurface migration determine dispersion distance, persistence, and receptor exposure.
  </p>

  <h3>Idea</h3>
  <p>
    “Invisible Borders” proposes a shift in perspective: environmental pollution should be understood not only as a chemical phenomenon but as a transport-driven physical system.
  </p>

  <p>
    The project emphasizes preventive intervention at the level of transport pathways. By analyzing airflow dynamics, runoff behavior, and pollutant mobility, it demonstrates that modifying physical conditions can significantly limit dispersion and environmental availability.
  </p>

  <h3>Approach</h3>
  <p>
    The project follows an interdisciplinary framework integrating physics (fluid dynamics and dispersion principles), chemistry (volatility, solubility, and adsorption characteristics), biology (exposure pathways and bioaccumulation risks), mathematics (conceptual modeling), and informatics (digital visualization and structured documentation).
  </p>

  <p>
    The study is grounded in independently developed conceptual models and established scientific knowledge from peer-reviewed literature and international institutions such as WHO and EEA.
  </p>

  <h3>Innovation</h3>
  <p>
    The project reframes environmental pollution as a transport-controlled physical process rather than solely a chemical contamination issue, emphasizing preventive control of dispersion mechanisms instead of post-impact remediation.
  </p>

  <h3>Impact</h3>
  <p>
    “Invisible Borders” supports early-stage prevention strategies that reduce pollutant exposure in industrial and peri-urban areas, contributing to safer environmental planning and improved public awareness.
